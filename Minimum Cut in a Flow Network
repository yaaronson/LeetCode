Explanation: 
The given Python code solves the problem of finding the minimum cut in a flow network, which is a set of edges that, if removed, would disconnect the source node from the sink node. 
The solution uses the Edmonds-Karp algorithm, an implementation of the Ford-Fulkerson method for computing the maximum flow in the network. 
The `edmonds_karp` function calculates the maximum flow by repeatedly finding augmenting paths with breadth-first search (BFS) and updating the flow values. 
After computing the maximum flow, the `min_cut` function identifies the minimum cut by checking which nodes are reachable from the source in the residual graph. The edges that cross from reachable nodes to non-reachable nodes constitute the minimum cut. 
The code includes an example graph setup and demonstrates how to find and print the edges that form the minimum cut.
